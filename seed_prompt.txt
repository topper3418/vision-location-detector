This application will use aiohttp to stream camera footage to a webpage.

It will use yolo to detect any people that may be in the frame. 
This is for the Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano hardware, so use accelerators.

The application will also print out on screen a list of detected people, 
with their approximate location being displayed. 

The camera will be angled downward by 45 degrees, in order to properly 
see the floor.
